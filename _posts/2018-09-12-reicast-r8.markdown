We've been very busy the past months, silently pushing r7, opening the public beta program, and a lot of work in both the android and core parts of the emulator.

Reicast r8.1 released

Working towards the goal of doing a stable release per month, r8.1 got promoted today from beta to production!

For more details see, https://github.com/reicast/reicast-emulator/releases/tag/r8.1


Publishing progress reports

I've been really short on time, so I guess ... that's all for now? Will try to keep everyone more updated over Autumn :)

Enjoy,
